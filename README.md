# Srishti v3 (MEL)
This is a MEL code for viewable renderings and time adjustments with one click. You can see the renders while they happen in Maya and save them too.
Maya batch renders do not display the images while they render so instead of using that we can use Maya renderview and view the renders while they happen. This makes it easier to spot the mistakes.

*Please note:
This works best if you have a project setup and have defined the image output extention.

To use this code:
Copy the ".mel" script or copy the code in the mel script in the script editor.
Execute.
Enjoy!
